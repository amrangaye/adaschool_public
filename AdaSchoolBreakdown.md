  #  AdaSchool Proposal Share

AdaSchool is the flagship product of DundalAI, Gambia’s first AI Products and Services company. It is a comprehensive Digital School System, connecting parents, students, teachers and school administrators to create a rich and effective learning environment in which students thrive.  

AdaSchool is built using the latest cutting-edge AI technologies. Below are the AI Products that AdaSchool offers.  Each of them is available on any internet-connected device, via apps or a web portal, in an accessible manner that also includes kids with disabilities.  

## Products 

AdaSchool will provide multiple AIs for the following roles:
- **Student** - A person attending your school
- **Teacher** - A person who instructs students 
- **Parent** - A person with a child attending your school
- **Administrator** - A principal, superintendent, auditor, etc who needs access to high-level data for planning and logistical purposes

With AdaSchool, each of these roles will have its own individual and personalised AI. 
 
### AdaLearn AI (for Students)

AdaLearn is a personal digital study teacher and learning guide for students. Each student will have their own AdaLearn AI, giving them dedicated and customised help through the course of their education. It is available 24/7, and can be used at any time, even outside of school hours.  It knows all the major languages, and is an expert on every subject in your syllabus. 

Each AdaLearn will use the latest AI technology to tailor themselves to a student’s experience. As a study teacher, AdaLearn will prioritise understanding and take into account a student’s weak points. Since it has access to all the student’s scores, grades and other school data, it can tailor each study session to the exact student, rather than use a one size fits all approach. 

As an AI system, AdaLearn will have capabilities that allow it to adapt to its student as they proceed, from when they enrolled in the school to when they graduate (all through which they will be attached to the same AI). Amongst other things, AdaLearn will provide the following capabilities:

1) Homework Helper. AdaLearn will work with students through homework problems. It will not give them the final solutions, but instead work through the problem with them, explaining each step and testing them with similar problems until they can understand and provide the solutions themselves.  
2) Research Assistant: A student can use AdaLearn to do research to understand material better or to inform an assignment. The Research Assistant lets students directly ask questions across all subjects, such as:
   1) “What was Gambia like during the fight for Independence? Describe the mood in the country, the main actors at the time and the part each played”. 
   2) “What factors led to the ending of colonisation in Africa?”
   3) “What plants can grow naturally in Gambia that can also be exported? “
   4) "I am struggling to understand the Pythagorean theorem. Explain it to me using the simplest language possible” 
   5) “What are my current grades in Biology and how do I improve them?”
   
   NOTE: The research assistant will refuse to write any essays or do any tests for students, but only help them find the information they need. 

3) Language Tutor. AdaLearn is also an expert virtual language tutor that can create scenarios and have multi-lingual conversations with students. Using French for example, each student’s AdaLearn will have French conversations with its student over time, gently correcting mistakes and providing translations. As the student grows more proficient, AdaLearn will notice and automatically adjust the difficulty to make it higher, and vice versa. Not limited to text, AdaLearn can also speak to the student to teach them correct pronunciation. This gives each student a bespoke language teacher moving at their exact pace and catering exclusively to them. 

4) Career Mentor & Guidance Counsellor. Given that AdaLearn has comprehensive information about each student and their learning journey, it can work with them to create a career plan, asking questions about what they want to pursue and creating guides and making suggestions that will lead them on the path to getting there.  AdaLearn will give continuous advice on how the material the student is covering will advance their larger career goals. It will also suggest classes, events and books based on this chosen path. 

5) Exam Prep. AdaLearn has been trained on ALL past exams and tests available online, for all common exams such as GCSE, WASSCE, SAT and TOEFL. Using this and your school’s syllabus, AdaLearn will create prep exams based on its particular student’s needs and what they struggle with. It will automatically mark these exams, give tips, and provide coaching solving similar problems in future. By looking at these past papers,  AdaLearn is able to come up with new mock exams specifically for the student’s needs. These can then be administered periodically, which AdaLearn will then use to suggest improvements. 

### AdaParent  

AdaParent is an AI that allows a parent or guardian to participate fully in their enrolled child’s learning journey. As with AdaLearn, each parent will have their own personal AdaParent AI that they can securely access on any device they use.  Each AdaParent AI will connect to the AdaLearn AI of their kids, giving parents the following capabilities.: 

1) Monitor their child’s progress. Rather than just with reports at the end of term, parents will be able to use their AdaParent AI to get up-to-the-minute breakdowns of their child’s grades, class attendance and participation, how they are doing in each particular subject and where they are struggling. In short their AdaParent AI will give them access to all information, scores and statistics concerning their child, in a continuous and up to date fashion.  
2) Encouragement Plans. AdaParent will give suggestions to parents on how to encourage their child to follow and develop their interests while learning. These suggestions will include books, films, extracurricular activities, events, school clubs etc, that the AI has analysed from the school calendar, their child’s activities, achievements and interests. This schedule will be customised to their kid.   
3) Calendar and Reminders. AdaParent AI is also a dynamic calendar for parents. It will include schedules of all school activities: sports matches, recitals, performances, PTA meetings, graduations etc. AdaParent will create schedules for parents for their respective children, and send reminders and action items about it. Once an event is completed, each AdaParent will create a meeting summary and task list for each parent. 
4) Communications. AdaParent creates communications channels between parents and teachers. This will consist of a class group for each class, and individual communications between parents and teachers, set up through the AI. 
5) Safety. AdaParent will always be in contact with your child’s AdaLearn, co-ordinating activities and sending you alerts and notifications regarding your child’s progress. 

### AdaTeacher

AdaTeacher is an AI Teacher’s Assistant (TA) built for teachers to help them reduce overhead and take care of routine teaching activities. Each teacher will have their own AdaTeacher AI running on their devices, tailored to their subject areas and teaching style. AdaTeacher will do the following for each teacher: 

1) Prepare detailed lesson plans for its teacher before each lecture, specific to their students and classes for that day, and what they have covered so far. This will include not only items from the syllabus, but also useful material online such as videos, audio and other material found that is age appropriate and germane to that class. AdaTeacher will also make suggestions on enhancing the syllabus based on grades in that class. 
2) Create homework automatically based on covered material and previous scores. These will be sent directly to each student’s AdaStudent AI, which will then coach them through it and communicate back scores. 
3) Automated grading of exams and tests. AdaTeacher will be able to automate the grading of exams and steps it has created in step 1.  The teacher then only has to do a final review. 
4) Automatically create detailed end of term Reports, in collaboration with each student’s AdaLearn AI. Rather than writing out subject scores and a summary of their behavior, this will be a very detailed report about their class engagement, scores, activities at school, extra curriculars, disciplinary issues, etc. The AdaTeacher AI will then provide a brief summary of discussion points its teacher should bring up and areas of concern. The AI will also suggest interventions that could help. These will be available through the AdaParent AI for each parent or guardian with students enrolled. 
5) Communicate with Parents, individually or as a group  - the AI will create channels between teachers and parents, either as a group or one to one. This consolidates and archives all communications on one platform, rather than have it spread across whatsapp, email, etc. 
6) Automatically Draft Tests and Exams by looking at the syllabus and previous tests and assignments archives. 
7) Student Evaluation. AdaTeacher AI will allow its teacher to take a detailed look at class and individual levels to track how a students or group of students is doing.  

In short AdaLearn will significantly reduce the amount of overhead teachers currently have to go through. This means the teacher can concentrate on teaching, which will lead to better outcomes for students. 

### AdaManager

AdaManager is an AI backed system that will be used by administrators at the school.  It gives the admin a high level overview of all school operations, as well as detailed reports and metrics showing all activity at the school, whether by staff or students. It will show gaps in the school’s education system, and make suggestions on how to fix them. In general it will provide timely information that allows school administrators to make decisions and set the right policy. AdaManager will have the following capabilities, amongst others. 

1) Student Monitoring and Evaluation: As with AdaTeacher, the AdaManager AI will let admins view individual information about a student, but AdaManager goes one step further and lets you do the same but for all the school at once. 
2) Staff Evaluations - in addition to Student Evaluation, AdaManager will also carry out staff evaluations at the end of each term. This will be merely advisory and propose improvements - AdaManager will never make any decisions regarding HR and personnel. 
3) Analytics: AdaManager, with its understanding of the school, students, teachers will give managers the ability to talk to the AI about the school itself. Some examples:
   1) “What is the current failure rate for Calculus, and give me suggestions to improve it”
   2) “Create an Excel spreadsheet containing all teacher evaluations in the last three months, ranked by student exam scores”
   3) “Which students are struggling with biology, and how can we help them catch up?”
   4) Summarize the last PTA meeting. 
   5) What is our current satisfaction score amongst parents who enrolled last year? 
      etc, etc. If you can ask a question in English, AdaManager AI will answer it. 
4) Working with the AdaTeacher AI, AdaManager will create school wide syllabuses and help massage them into exactly what your school wants with your own input. 

### Privacy & Security

AdaLearn is built so that:
- All student interactions with their AI is ALWAYS private, except for that required by law to be accessed. This will make the students comfortable enough to interact with their AI which creates a good environment for learning. 
- The AIs will refuse to carry out any illegal actions on behalf of any user. 
- The AIs will **never** give instructions on how to create illegal materials.
- The AIs will **never** do anything that could make the school liable. 
- Outside of the school syllabus and related materials, the AI will only allow specific knowledge bases to be used. This will eliminate hallucinations by the AI.
- The student’s information is completely private, except to the corresponding AdaParent, AdaTeacher and AdaManager 
- The AI will **never** give direct answers to test problems. Instead it will show the student the method to use then have them try and reach the conclusion themselves.  In the same regard, since we have a copy of all tests and exams in the system, the AI will quickly verify that it is not being asked to write an essay for example that was assigned through AdaLearn. 

All three different AIs will be continuously maintained and kept safe from cybersecurity attacks whether internal or external. They will also be retrained periodically to acquire more capabilities. We also have DundalAI dedicated support agents to react to any functional issues on time and ensure your systems keep running in a safe and private manner. 

### Onboarding 

All schools have many cabinets full of paper: syllabuses and lesson plans; tests and exam papers and results; roll call registers; report cards; receipts for payments;  etc. Traditionally, all these materials would need to be typed out again to convert them to digital. This is an arduous process involving a lot of bodies. With DundalAI, we will simply scan all papers of any of the kind listed above, and then convert them using our AI system. For example, just from the scans of reports AdaLearn will be able to track any student’s progress across their whole school attendance, and make recommendations to improve. All the AI systems above will also have the same ability to learn and improve.

After we have digitised all the information about your school, we will then use it to train a customised AdaSchool AI system for your school. While other AI systems will use outside companies, we do all our training at DundalAI in Gambia. This ensures that your data is private and secure, and never available on the public internet. 

### Training

AdaLearn, AdaTeacher, AdaParent and AdaManager are the first systems of their kind in Gambia. Therefore we will need to carry out training for every user of the system (from the students to the managers) in order to introduce them to the new features before we then assign them an AI.  

Once the training is completed, your school can have an AI launching ceremony which will be widely publicised and highlight your innovation. DundalAI will provide demos and presentations to show what you are offering.
